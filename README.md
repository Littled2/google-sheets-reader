## Installation

1. Copy the `google-sheets-reader.js` file so it can be served to your frontend.
2. Include the script in your webpage using the following:
    ```html
    <script src="/google-sheets-reader.js"></script>
    ```
3. Call the function `get_google_sheet()` with the public URL of your Google sheet's webpage. This returns a JS promise with your parsed Google sheet.
4. Voila! You can access the rows and columns using the `getRow()` and `getColumn()` methods.
